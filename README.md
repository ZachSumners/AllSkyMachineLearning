This repository contains a pretrained convolutional neural network to detect weather conditions based on input from the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory's (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) All Sky Camera. The network was trained on a local machine, and this repository contains the final algorithm.

It classifies images into one of six categories, ranging from daytime (overexposed images), to clear, to cloudy. 

The next step is to use the weather classifications to cross reference with the Sky Quality Meter (SQM), and bundle clear night conditions with clear SQM data.
